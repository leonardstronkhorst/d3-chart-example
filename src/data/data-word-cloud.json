Working in a task combining hardware and software. See how all the rest of teams had something successful to present. Coding some backend stuff coding without worrying about tests or writing clean code! collaboration Colleagues from Madrid office coming over. Completed projects instead of just a bunch of screenshots dont remember now Finishing the Hackathon item I was working on and the demoing part. I enjoyed working with a different group of people, rather than the ones I am used to working with I liked to see all different ideas people come up with.  Interesting and fun ideas, all teams delivered something by the end of the day It keeps being fun and seems that the H-team gets better and more efficient in organizing it. Good job! it was well organized and I liked that every project ended with a working prototype jouke test meeting (some of) the colleagues from abroad in person Projects were good and generally a nice atmosphere smaller groups and more participation possibilities (also for non-developers). smaller teams (if you are talking of winter 2018) spending time together Teamworking That all projects were sort of finished at the end of the day. And some of them were really impressive! That something possibly useful came out The ideas and the output of these ideas.
